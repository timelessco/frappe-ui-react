# frappe-ui-react

A React component library implementing Frappe's Espresso UI design system.

## Overview

frappe-ui-react is a comprehensive React component library that implements Frappe's Espresso UI design system. While Frappe officially uses Vue.js internally, this library bridges the gap for React developers in the Frappe ecosystem who want to maintain consistent design language across their applications.

## Why This Library?

### Community Need

The Frappe ecosystem provides excellent tools including a [React SDK](https://github.com/The-Commit-Company/frappe-react-sdk) for backend interactions, but lacks official React UI components. This forces React developers to either:
- Build UI components from scratch
- Use inconsistent UI libraries that don't match Frappe's design language
- Switch to Vue.js (which might not be feasible for existing React projects)

### Design Consistency
This library ensures React applications can maintain the same look and feel as official Frappe products which used [frappe-ui](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui) like:
- Gameplan
- Frappe Cloud
- Helpdesk


## Features

- Complete set of base components (Buttons, Inputs, etc.)
- Fully typed with TypeScript
